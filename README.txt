# Ghost Slayer Game
This is an interactive game written in C made for a Game Boy Advanced emulator.

## Description

The Ghost Slayer is stranded in space and separated from its spaceship, and it will run out of air in 30 seconds! Help the ghost slayer get back to its spaceship without hitting any of the ghosts are before it's too late. Unlike its name, the timid Ghost Slayer is too scared to kill ghosts, so it must be sneaky and outrun the random ghosts and get back to its spaceship, the finish line.


## Game Play
* Help the cowardly ghost slayer get back to his spaceship without hitting any of the ghosts!
* You must move the ghost slayer to the finish line (the spaceship) before the time runs out.
* If the slayer hits a ghost or runs out of air, the slayer dies and you lose!
